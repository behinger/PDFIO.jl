Excerpts from reference article from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html">GNU Website</a> provided here for reference:</p><blockquote><p>There is no special patent threat to GIF format nowadays as far as we know;  the patents that were used to attack GIF have expired. Nonetheless, this  article will remain pertinent as long as programs can be forbidden by patents, since the same sorts of things could happen in any area of computing. See our  web site policies regarding GIFs, and our web guidelines.</p><p>...</p><p>We were able to search the patent databases of the USA, Canada, Japan, and the European Union. The Unisys patent expired on 20 June 2003 in the USA,  in Europe it expired on 18 June 2004, in Japan the patent expired on 20 June 2004 and in Canada it expired on 7 July 2004. The U.S. IBM patent expired 11 August 2006. The Software Freedom Law Center says that after 1 October 2006, there will be no significant patent claims interfering with the use of static GIFs.</p><p>Animated GIFs are a different story. We do not know what patents might cover  them. However, we have not heard reports of threats against use of animated  GIFs. Any software can be threatened by patents, but we have no reason to  consider animated GIFs to be in particular danger — no particular reason to  shun them.</p></blockquote><h2><a class="nav-anchor" id="Licenses-of-third-party-libraries-or-data-1" href="#Licenses-of-third-party-libraries-or-data-1">Licenses of third party libraries or data</a></h2><h3><a class="nav-anchor" id="OpenSSL-1" href="#OpenSSL-1">OpenSSL</a></h3><p><em>This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit.
